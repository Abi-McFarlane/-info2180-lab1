 <p>Hi, nice to meet you! I am a final year Actuarial Science student studying at the University of the West Indies, Mona. </p>
 <p>My favourite colour is turquoise and I absolutely hate macaroni and cheese. My favourite ice-cream flavour is strawberry swirl and my favourite cake is black forest cake. </p>
 <p>The world is currently in its technological state, and the importance of technology will only increase as the years go by. Web development is a nice skill to have as it can help me to be marketable. It is my absolute pleasure to be doing this course, and I look forward to learning as much as possible. </p>
